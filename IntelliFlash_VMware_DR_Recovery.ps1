.SYNOPSIS
For quick recovery of VM's in DR site, leveraging IntelliFlash API to clone
 Replica datastores, and PowerCLI to mount them, register, and power-up VM's

.DESCRIPTION
This script will allow you to connect to vCenter, or a standalone host, and your IntelliFlash array, to recover VM's
 from replica snapshots via API calls to clone replica projects, mount datastores, register and optionally power on VM's

*Notice: No support for this is implied or provided. No warranty or liability for any damage or loss due to its use is provided by Western Digitial Corporation or any of its divisions or subsidiaries.

*Important: This script Requires that the Tegile cmdlet be imported and all commands within it available: Import-Module .\Tegile_IntelliFlash_cmdlet.psm1

This has to be run separately for Projects in different IntelliFlash Pools. Know which pool your Projects are in, and thus just run this twice if your DR array is Active/Active.

Does not support "switching replication source" on Reversible replication jobs - only Clones from latest replica snapshot today

Does not support changing Block protocol on target. E.g. if source is Fibre Channel, this only works with target that has/supports Fibre Channel, it cannot change to iSCSI for clones.

Does not support simultaneous iSCSI and FC support. If you'll be cloning Project(s) with LUN's, then for any given run it must be either iSCSI or FC not both.

Along the same lines as the above, if you specify Target/Initiator Groups for the incorrect or mismatched protocol or pool then things will just fail.

Same goes for getting group names and/or NFSServerIP correct for the pool. If you get them wrong you'll get plenty of errors.

Mixing one Block protocol and NFS with the same run is supported, e.g. if you have Generic Projects that contain NFS & iSCSI datasets, or separate Projects for each.

It's also absolutely necessary that none of the Projects/Datasets be already present/mounted as datastores on your target vSphere infrastructure. Duplicates are not accounted for so things will fail.

For either iSCSI or FC, you need to make sure things are all configured and working in advance. E.g. iSCSI initiator discovery IP(s), FC zoning, Target & Initiator group configuration validated, etc.

Same goes for NFS. Just test your setup in advance and if you can mount a datastore of a given protocol successfully the old fashioned way then this script should work.

This makes the assumption that all .vmx files are accurately named the same as the VM display name. Keep your vm folders and files named consistently, and don't rename VM's!

Similarly, this makes the assumption that LUN/Share names match Datastore names precisely, case-sensitive. If they don't, fix them on source first!

This will automatically attempt to register *all* VM's found in *all* cloned/mounted datastores. If you have unwanted VM's still in the datastores, you'll want to clean those up on source first.

All VM Networks from source vSphere environment need to exist on recovery hosts, otherwise Power On will definitely fail and you'll have to manually fix networking before powering on VM's.

Requires PowerShell version 5 or better, and PowerCLI version 10 or better

Tested with vSphere 6.7u1. It will probably work with many earlier versions as well, but like everything else in this script there are no guarantees!

This script has several parameters, which will autocomplete after '-':

	*Mandatory:
	-Projects | Comma-separated list of IntelliFlash Projects which you wish to recover
	-Array | Specify the IP or FQDN of the IntelliFlash array hosting the Replica(s) you wish to clone
	-VCServer | Specify the IP or FQDN of the vCenter Server or ESXi Host
	
	*Optional:
	-NFSServerIP | NFS Server IP for mounting NFS datastores (from IntelliFlash array, see High Availability page and look for IP associated with pool from which you're cloning)
	-NACLHost | Comma-separated list of Host VMkernel IP's or subnet to provide r/w/root NFS access (required for NFS datastores; can specify /24 subnet like: 10.42.42.0, CIDR not yet supported)
	-TargetGroup | Target Group to which to map access for any/all Projects which have LUN's
	-InitiatorGroup | Comma-separated list of Initiator Group(s) to which to map access for any/all Projects which have LUN's
	-Cluster | Specify a specific cluster (or even a folder) rather than the default which is to select first host from all available to use for registering VM's
	-VMHost | Specify a specific ESXi Host to use for registering the VM's, rather than the default which is to use the first host listed
	-PowerOn | Power up the VM's after registering them (which will also automatically answer the moved/copied question with "moved") - Default is to leave Powered Off
	-ScanWait | For Block/VMFS datastores only, this sets the number of seconds to wait between rescan/check for LUN attach/mount. Default is 2 seconds, some environments may need longer for attach/mount to succeed.
	-AcceptDisclaimer | Accept the disclaimer without being prompted to do so within the script - you accept all responsibility anyway!
	-VCUser | Optionally specify the user account for vCenter or Host connectivity
	-VCPassword | Optionally specify the password for the designated user account
	-IFUser | Optionally specify the IntelliFlash user account
	-IFPassword | Optionally specify the IntelliFlash password
	-Version (alias: -ver, -v) | Returns script version

.EXAMPLE
.\IntelliFlash_VMware_DR_Recovery.ps1 -Projects VMware-Prod,VMware-Test -NACLHost 192.168.240.0 -Array 10.42.42.42 -NFSServerIP 192.168.240.42 -VCServer vc1.wdc.local
Connects to the vCenter server vc1.wdc.local, and clones latest replica snapshot of specified projects,
sets NFS NACL's as specified, then mounts all NFS shares from those clones as datastores using server IP specified,
on all hosts, and finally finds and registers all VM's from those datastores.

.EXAMPLE
.\IntelliFlash_VMware_DR_Recovery.ps1 -Projects VMware-Prod,VMware-Test -NACLHost 192.168.240.0 -Array 10.42.42.42 -NFSServerIP 192.168.240.42 -VCServer vc1.wdc.local -Cluster Production -VMHost 10.42.42.44 -PowerOn
Connects to the vCenter server vc1.wdc.local, and clones latest replica snapshot of specified projects,
sets NFS NACL's as specified, then mounts all NFS shares from those clones as datastores using server IP specified,
on only hosts in specified cluster (or host folder), and finds and registers all VM's from those datastores on just
the host specified. Then it powers on all VM's succesffully registered, and answers VM question with "moved".

.EXAMPLE
.\IntelliFlash_VMware_DR_Recovery.ps1 -Array 10.42.42.42 -VCServer vc1.wdc.local -Projects VMware-Prod-NFS,VMware-Prod-iSCSI -NACLHost 192.168.240.101,192.168.240.102 -NFSServerIP 192.168.240.42 -TargetGroup default-pool-a-iscsi-target-group -InitiatorGroup ESX-DR -PowerOn
Similar to previous example, but includes Project with both NFS & iSCSI datasets,
and thus also the associated Target/Initiator groups for which to add mapping
